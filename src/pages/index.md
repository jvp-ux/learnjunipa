#   description: >
#     Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
#     shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
#     directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
#     profits are reinvested in their communities.
# description: >-
#   Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
#   java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
#   roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
#   anyone.
