**St Jude has a student population of 350, they currently adjust for 95 of those students. St Jude received \$1.7M NCCD Funding in the last reporting year.**

## So many files in so many places!

St Jude kept NCCD records using an in-house method. This method combined efforts from the Learning and Enhancement team as well as ICT staff. The system was great at delivering reports for audit, so long as all the required information was present. The school had successfully passed an audit to secure funding and now it was time to move beyond purely compliance and into improving Quality of Teaching.

## Collaboration = more productivity.

St Jude was the ideal school for JUNIPA as staff were dispersed across multiple small campuses. JUNIPA would act as the new source of truth and help the collaboration for NCCD adjustments and preparation. In no time, the team was iterating planned adjustments and collaborating in a single location - running meetings on JUNIPA. Feedback was solicited through JUNIPA case notes and internal stakeholders were notified of any changes. Parents and guardians of students then had access to a complete picture of their child's plan - prepared through JUNIPA.

<p class="message message-body"> "We didn't need to physically share a screen or location to collaborate on student adjustments or IEPs - rather we can follow along, all within JUNIPA to sign-off and administer adjustments. I could see when my staff had made changes and if I needed to provide contents, it all remained within the notes of the student. " </p>

The Principal and Business Manager of St Jude could forecast their budget and expected funding -all within a single view. As a result, the planning was flipped on it's head - with the Learning and Enhancement team informing the budget.

The the review process between staff and students became significantly shorter but even better.

### Traceable, auditable and repeatable outcomes

JUNIPA helped the Learning and Enhancment team create a sustainable system. system work in a separate space, drop in adjustments and notes and make updates to fit within the school plan for each student.

<p class="message message-body">"From day 1 we made it clear that switching to JUNIPA wasn't about saving time.  Instead, we wanted our effort to have a greater impact on our students - and that's why we made the switch.  We work just as hard, but now we have something that gives back to us as well - and helps us stay ahead rather than fall behind. " </p>

<p class="message message-body">"We also found that JUNIPA leveled the playing field and made the planning process more democratic - which is what our team had been pushing for so long! " </p>

### A small team makes a big impact.

The Learning and Enhancement team at St Jude started to capture the attention of the executive members. The team was fast moving, collaborative and began informing the outcome of meetings rather than reacting.  JUNIPA helped the team consolidated their tools and efforts, tightening up their complex sign-offs and centralised all evidence.

<p class="message message-body"> "We now have a dynamic, collaborative environment that enables us to brainstorm together, bounce ideas off one another and ultimately provide greater care to our students. " </p>

### What's next?

**Onboarding systems**
The St Jude team is embarking on a new journey to build more consistency across student onboarding. Following the principles of the NCCD guidelines, the goal is to have a streamlined onboarding process for students. The process remains unique to the individual needs of the student, with all of the documentation sign-offs cut down to minutes, rather than weeks. As the school moves towards standardising on JUNIPA, they're looking to define their own NCCD process to be used across their sister schools. The sky's the limit for St Jude.

**Cultural adjustments**
St Jude had an increasing number of immigrant students, all with unique backgrounds contributing to their learning and social interactions. The first cultural adjustment was eye contact. Some immigrant students did not maintain eye contact with teachers, not out of disrespect but because of their culture. Having this information at a teacher's finger tips - especially a casual teacher - made interactions and adjustments better aligned with each student.

**Off site adjustments**
St Jude often provides transport and care outside of school hours. JUNIPA now makes it possible for staff to provide case notes and adjustments as well as refer to notes entered throughout the day.

<p class="message message-body"> "I can sit on my phone and look at all the things that have contributed to a student's behaviour - making my job a lot easier. " â€” Learning and Enhancement team officer" </p>
