## Convincing your school to switch to JUNIPA - the NCCD management tool - isn't easy. Moving to a cloud-based, collaborative aproach to NCCD is a cultural shift.

One Head of Learning and Enhancement coordinator took a step-by-step approach to moving to Figma, making sure she had school-side support for the change. Introducing JUNIPA was about more than just a new tool. It was about shifting the teaching and adjustment to:

<p class="message message-body">"How can we make NCCD a school-wide responsibility and not just a responsiblity for the Learning and Enhancement team?"</p>

## Current approach

Jacob College uses a manual method of collecting the required NCCD adjustment data, taking staff many hours in the process:

1. Welfare staff **have created spreadsheets** on the internal share drive:

   Teachers access the shared files periodically and add update the adjustments for each student<br>
   Some teachers do this daily, but most attempt updates at the end of the week <br><br>

2. Welfare staff often have to **chase** teachers to update and complete data
3. Welfare staff **collect** documentary evidence from emails and scanned documents
4. Welfare staff **collate** this information into printed folders for reporting periods
5. Welfare staff **prepare** folders of printed information for reporting/auditing

## The hidden cost of using spreadsheets

  <h2 class="has-text-info">New approach</h2>

<p>A total of 1 full time equivalent (FTE) staffing costs per year were being lost on manual processes and tasks. Jacob College was using qualified staff as a brute force way of ensuring NCCD compliance. As more and more requirements were introduced for compliance, it was obvious that this approach was unsustainable.</p>

<p>JUNIPA does the heavy lifting, and is priced less than than a teacher's aide. JUNIPA frees up qualified staff to do what they're trained for and have a passion for - teaching students.</p>

<p>The decision to implement JUNIPA made the school confident in providing evidence for the 200 students, and provided funding to support additional welfare staff. Staff that were spending less time documenting, and more time providing individualised care for students. </p>

<p class="message message-body"> "By increasing the adjusted student reporting by only 50 students, Jacob College can receive an increase in NCCD funding of over a million dollars." </p>

<h3 class="has-text-info">Progressing to reflection</h3>

<p>Two Teachers were undertaking a Behaviour support plan meeting, when another teacher was making adjustments at the same time.</p>

<p>These adjustments started a new conversations that wouldn't have happened otherwise. This is not something that occurs with spreadsheets filed away. </p>
