## Convincing your school to switch to an NCCD management tool like JUNIPA isn't easy. Moving to a cloud-based, collaborative approach to NCCD is a cultural shift.

One Head of Learning and Enhancement coordinator - we will call her Helen - took a step-by-step approach to moving to JUNIPA, making sure she had school-side support for the change. Introducing JUNIPA was about more than just a new tool. It was about shifting the teaching and adjustment to:

<p class="message message-body">"How can we make NCCD a school-wide responsibility and not just a responsibility for the Learning and Enhancement team?"</p>

## Step 1 - Discovery

Helen could see the collaborative and time saving advantages for her team but would the business manager's see the value? To get started Helen sent a school-wide email with the subject "I am testing a new NCCD tool, please contact me if you would like to join in". Helen had a handful of teachers reach out and discuss the pain points of their current approach:

- Double-handling of paper work or spreadsheets,
- Siloed teams prevented collaboration throughout the school,
- Paper work is forgotten and never referenced again, and
- Audit preparation takes too long.

## Step 2 - Show, don't tell

Helen shared a hyperlink to the <a href="https://demo.junipa.com.au">JUNIPA demo </a> for teachers and her team to walk through. Helen took feedback and talked through the school's current workflows and challenges. Helen then lobbied that JUNIPA could fix these issues and trusted that once people tried JUNIPA in a real world setting then the collaboration and time saving features would prove themselves. Convincing teachers was only half of the battle...

<p class="message message-body">"Our teachers will love it if it saves them time - but we need to convince the business manager as JUNIPA isn't free and I have no idea about our operating budgets. "</p>

## Step 3 - Motivate the decision makers

The school had gone through and passed a NCCD audit in the previous year. Audit preparation was a pain staking 4 week process but in the eyes of the business manager - why fix something that wasn't broken?

### Money and time

The business manager at Helen's school had the question, "Didn't we pass last year, why do we need to spend money to do this again?". Helen realised she needed to speak on the same level and responded with:

<div class="message message-body" style="background: #FFFFEC; font-size: 1em; font-family: George, serif; padding: 5em; border: 1px solid #FFEC76; margin-top: 2em; text-shadow: 0 0 1px black;">
<h3>Why should we switch to JUNIPA?</h3>

First the direct funding benefits:

- Increase our NCCD funding by at least \$99,000 by offering support to 6 additional students identified as requiring adjustments,
- Further increase our NCCD funding by \$48,000 through transitioning 4 students from supplementary to substantial level of adjustments,
- Receiving an additional \$30,000 in NCCD funding as 2 students requiring substantial adjustments transition to extensive,

Then the time benefits:

- Remove the need for NCCD compliance as this is all built-in, and available to the business managers and principal via a login,
- Remove the need for NCCD audit preparation - this took 4 weeks and 2 staff last year!
- Reduce the Student Planning meetings duration by 50% - last year we spent most of our time just collecting all the adjustment notes,
- Reduce the overhead of RFF dedicated to NCCD adjustments for stage coordinators,
- Reduce the administration time allocated to preparing "Learning and Enhancement notes" for casual staff,
- Remove the support responsibilities of the ICT team to support the current manual system.

This was all in addition to the quality of teaching improvements, but a business manager speaks in money and time.

The school had a protective ICT team who did not want to take on extra support for a new system. Helen shared <a href="https://junipa.com.au/files/junipa.pdf">the JUNIPA brochure</a> with the ICT team and referenced the **For IT Managers** section. This was enough to satisfy the ICT manager - as support and implementation was managed by the JUNIPA team.

<h3>Now who's the biggest advocate? </h3>

<p class="message message-body">
"Once we gave our business manager a login to the JUNIPA reports screen, he quickly became the most active user of JUNIPA.  When the new IEP add-on for JUNIPA started to advertised to school it was our business manager who suggested we go for it. "
</p>

## Conclusion

Helen had to prove that the compliance costs of _not_ having JUNIPA took $180,000 in funding away from the school. Combined with the existing funding the school was now receiving in excess of $900,000 in NCCD funding. The business manager realised that JUNIPA helped identify this funding gap and removed extra overheads for support staff.
