**Lester Street Public is a suburban primary and secondary school with a population of 280. The school currently adjusts for 60 of these students. Lester Street Public received \$1.29M in NCCD funding in the last reporting year.**

## Current approach

When the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the school year and encouraged online-learning from home, the existing paper-based NCCD approach needed to change. In previous years, the school planned and adjusted for NCCD as follows:

1. Well-being staff created a Individualised Educational Plan (IEP) document on a shared drive for each student and printed this off to start the year
2. Teachers providing adjustments and case notes would use individual approaches including notebooks, sticky notes and email. Then every fortnight well-being staff member would request that all teachers:

   - Bring their paper-based notes into the staff room and separate these notes into a manilla folder for each student, collating these notes with email communication
   - Well-being staff would often have to chase teachers up to complete a data profile on a student
     <br><br>

3. The Head of well-being would then spend days on each student's folder by sorting notes into chronological order and identifying significant notes and adjustments. The adjustment weeks for each student would be tallied up kept in a spreadsheet against each student's name
4. For any student planning meetings a well-being staff member would collect an deliver student folders to the meeting
5. Well-being staff would then prepare/copy these folders for any reporting and auditing

## The cost of this paper-based approach to NCCD

<p>The school was spending nearly a full time equivalent (FTE) staffing costs per year on simply preparing, filing and retrieving NCCD documentation. The time taken for recording adjustments were extended due to the manual paper-based approach the school was using. The school was using this approach as, "It was the easiest to adopt at the time" and there was no incentive to change. </p>

<p>The time and effort allocated to their NCCD process was only half the issue. That approach simply would not streamline with online-learning and the decrease in face-to-face student planning meetings.</p>

<div class=" has-margin-bottom-30">
  <h2 class="has-text-info has-margin-bottom-30">The new NCCD approach paired with online-learning</h2>

<p>When JUNIPA was introduced into the school, 54 of the 60 students requiring adjustments were being home-schooled.  During the video call, the School Learning Support Officer (SLSO) or teacher would be recording adjustments, with a few mouse clicks or taps on their phone. Where relevant, all communication with parents and carers, as well as Occupational Therapist would be logged as a case note within JUNIPA. </p>

<p><strong>Following each video call, the recording of adjustments were complete</strong>. The next teacher to interact with that student could see previous adjustments and case notes and communicate accordingly. Interactions with each student were presented cohesively, as teach staff member could quickly and thoroughly communicate with each other. </p>

<h3 class="has-text-info">Elevating adjustment confidence</h3>

<p>As staff became accustomed to using JUNIPA, their confidence is making the correct decisions grew. Now adjustments and case notes could be referred to throughout the day. Staff were spending less time writing notes, and more time creating progressive plans more appropriate for online-learning. </p>

<div class="message message-body">
<p>The tool of choice has a massive impact on communication.  When adjustment evidence and case notes were being stored in manilla folders, there was a huge barrier for staff to stay on top of things. JUNIPA does the opposite, keeping teachers and student information <em>just a tap away</em>. </p>

<p>Because JUNIPA runs in the cloud, the collaboraiton issues stop immediately. Teachers can access student adjustments and case notes remain an integral part of communicating changes across the school.</p>
