## NCCD portal submission data

The _Student Disability data breakdown_ table collates the data required for NCCD data submission.  The data is live and provides an accurate snapshot of NCCD data and can be used as the reference point for NCCD reporting. 

The _None identified_ disability category remains an option for schools wish to declare NCCD inclusion without a clear disability category for a student.
