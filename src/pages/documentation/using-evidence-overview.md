## NCCD portal submission data

The *Student Disability data breakdown* table collates the data required for NCCD data submission.  The data is live and provides an accurate snapshot of NCCD data and can be used as the reference point for NCCD reporting. 

The *None identified* disability category remains an option for schools declaring NCCD inclusion for a student without assigning a disability category for that student.
