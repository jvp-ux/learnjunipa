## Linking your existing email address to Google Authentication

> Note: We suggest using your existing school email address and not your personal email address.   Completing this process simply means that you can use your existing email address to log in to Google services. This way if you ever forget your password you can perform a Google Forget Your Password lookup rather than rely on Junipa.
