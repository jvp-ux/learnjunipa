## Working with the evidence log

The *Student Evidence* record will show student's declared *Disability category*, *Adjustment level* and *Evidence log*.  The *Evidence log* will show detailed information on each evidence record: 

1. *Recorded date*: When the evidence was recorded. Note this date is the timestamp of the school staff member recording evidence, and will typically be after the event
2. *Evidence type*: What category of evidence was recorded, and does this evidence correlate to a student's Individual Education Plans (IEP)
3. *Location:*  Was the evidence recorded against a class/event in the past, and is there a file attachment to be used as evidence:  ![Student record](/img/audit-report-student-record-location-annotation.png "Student record")
4. *Recorded by:* Who recorded the evidence. 

#### Note

Only staff members with audit reporting privileges will be able to view audit data. 

The IEP module is an add-on module for schools requiring integration with Individual Education Plans (IEP) and recording adjustments.
