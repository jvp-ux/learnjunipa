## Audit reporting for an auditor

The audit report acts as a school ledger of all students included in the NCCD program for the selected reporting year.  Selecting each student row will display detailed information on that student.

A _Student Evidence_ record will show student's declared _Disability category_, _Adjustment level_ and _Evidence log_.  The _Evidence log_ will show detailed information on each evidence record: 

1. _Recorded date_: When the evidence was recorded. Note this date is the timestamp of the school staff member recording evidence, and will typically be after the event
2. _Evidence type_: What category of evidence was recorded, and does this evidence correlate to a student's Individual Education Plans (IEP)
3. _Location:_  Was the evidence recorded against a class/event in the past, and is there a file attachment to be used as evidence:  ![Student record](/img/audit-report-student-record-location-annotation.png "Student record")


4. _Recorded by:_ Who recorded the message. 



#### Note

Only staff members with audit reporting functionality will be able to view audit data. 

The IEP module is an add-on module for schools requiring integration with Individual Education Plans (IEP) and recording adjustments.
