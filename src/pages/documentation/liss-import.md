## What is LISS

LISS = Lightweight Interoperability Standard for Schools.

LISS is an interoperability standard designed for K-12 schools, to connect Timetable applications and other applications to Student Information Systems / School Admin Systems. It is a web-based protocol based on JSON, (or XmlRpc, although XmlRpc is discouraged). The goal is that the combined system should act semantically as if it was a single system i.e. with changes propagated in near-real time, even if there are different look and feels in use.  More information can be found at <a href="https://liss.org.au/docs/about">https://liss.org.au/docs/about</a>

To see if your timetabling and student managment system supports LISS view the supporting parties section on the LISS homepage: <a href="https://liss.org.au/">https://liss.org.au/</a>. 


## Prerequisites

> Step 1: Make sure Junipa has a term set up with the correct Term dates. This is an important prerequisite prior to importing from LISS.

## Identifying evidence frequency by calendar week

The *Identifying by calendar week* grid highlights school wide evidence tallies across the school, for the calendar year.  This grid is useful in identifying busy periods throughout the school year and to understand staff workload.

## NCCD portal submission data

The *Student Disability data breakdown* table collates the data required for NCCD data submission.  The data is live and provides an accurate snapshot of NCCD data and can be used as the reference point for NCCD reporting. 

The *None identified* disability category remains an option for schools declaring NCCD inclusion for a student without assigning a disability category for that student.
