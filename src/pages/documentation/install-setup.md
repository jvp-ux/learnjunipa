As each school has a different situation, a JUNIPA consultant will contact to work out the best way to get started.  We will discuss: 

* Management team\
  Who will be your school's management team to oversee the JUNIPA roll out. 
* Timetable management\
  Are you using a LISS enabled student management system, if so we can synchronise timetables with JUNIPA. 

If you have any questions open a [New Support Ticket](/contact).
