## What is a significant event?

A significant event is something extraordinary that has impacted a student. 

Significant events are recorded in Junipa and are then displayed on a <a href="/documentation/basics-101/#exercise-5/">student's narrative</a>, providing more context to staff.  A recurring historical event can remind staff, ahead of time, of the event so staff can plan accordingly.
